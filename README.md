## Description
- 3 credits
- Prerequisites: M 171Q or M 165Q
- COREQUISITE: CSCI 132

This course covers logic, discrete probability, recurrence relations, boolean algebra, sets, relations, counting, functions, maps, Big-O notation, proof techniques including induction, and proof by contradiction.

## Course information
MTWR 1200-1345	
This course meets on Mondays, Tuesday, Wednesdays, Thursday and Fridays from 12:00 p.m.–13:45 p.m. in Roberts 218. Course meetings consist of a combination of lectures, in-class activities, and quizzes. We will use Discord as the primary method of communication, and course information will be posted on d2l and github.

## Course resources

Textbook
* Connecting Discrete Mathematics and Computer Science by David Liben-Nowell. A free PDF version is available here: https://cs.carleton.edu/faculty/dln/book/. You can buy the physical book if you like to do so. 

## Course Assistants
No course assistants.

## Instructor Office hours
- TBD
- Barnard 349

## Grading
You will be graded on the following:

- 6 homework assignments (lowest score homework will be dropped out of 6 homeworks -- 5 homeworks will be used towards the final grade): 50%
- 3 tests: in class (including final): 30%
- In-class assignments (There will be a lot since this is a small class): 10%
- Attendance: 10%

## Computer Science Success Center
- There are free tutors availble in Barnard 259. https://www.cs.montana.edu/student-success-center.html (This may not be available during summer).

## Discord Server: 
All communication will be done via our course Discord Server. Please pay attention to messages in discord server. Please [change your nickname](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/219070107-Server-Nicknames#:~:text=If%20you're%20on%20the,new%20nickname%20of%20your%20choice!) to your full name (first and last). Additionally, I suggest managing your notification settings. Check out [Discord’s Notification Settings 101 page](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/215253258-Notifications-Settings-101) to get started. You may also need to manage the application notification settings on your device.

## Course outcomes
By following lectures, completing assignments and quizzes, and reading the textbook, students should:

- be able to read and use mathematical terminology around sets, functions, propositions, predicate logic, asymptotic notation, recursion, and graphs.

- be able to read and write mathematical proofs using the following methods:
	* Direct proofs
	* Proofs by counterexample
	* Proof by construction
	* Proofs by contradiction
	* Proofs by contrapositive
	* Proofs by induction
- improve their problem-solving skills and critical thinking skills.
	* using examples, counter-examples, diagrams, simpler cases, similar problems, etc., to better understand a mathematical statement
	* recognizing a broken proof or a false start and using it to find a new result or approach,
	
- thinking critically about which proof paradigm is most appropriate.

## Accommodations
If you have a documented disability and need or might need accommodations, please reach out the Office of Disability Services as soon as possible and then talk to me.

## SmartyCats tutoring
- [SmartyCats website](https://www.montana.edu/aycss/success/smartycats/)
- More information will be posted later.

## Collaboration policy
- For your homework assignments, you may discuss the problem with your peers.
- However, you are not allowed to copy proofs from your peers, use generative AI to complete your assignments.
- You MUST not post the solutions of the homeworks on the internet.

## Course survey and evaluation
If you complete the course survey and evaluation and submit proof, you will get 0.75 bonus points.

## Late assignment policies
I cannot accomodate individual requests for extensions on assignments because of the class size. Therefore, there will be 12 assignments and lowest score will be dropped.
- You are responsible for any announcements about assignments made in class, on Discord, on D2L, and here on the course website. You must pay attention to these announcements.
- You can submit as many times as you would like, the TA will only grade your last submission.
- If you submit within 24 hours of the due date, you get 25% off of the score you earn. If you submit within two days of the due date you get 50% off. Otherwise, no points are possible.

## Missing tests
If you are going to miss a test, you need to discuss this prior to missing the class. Serious illness or a serious family emergency are valid reasons requiring an accommodation, but other reasons are not (travel, employement schedule conflict).
